#### By _**Garrett Brown**_

## Description

_This is intended as a proof of knowledge for week 5 at Epicodus. Returns life expectancy on different planets. Created with TDD and Jest.

// 1.) Test if base properties are initialized. (galacticAge = age)
// 2.) Test if caculations apply properly to display users age on Mercury. if (mercuryAge, galacticAge = age * mercuryYears) 
// 3.) Test if caculations apply properly to display users age on Venus. if (venussAge, galacticAge = age * marsYears)
// 4.) Test if caculations apply properly to display users age on Mars. if (marsAge, galacticAge = age * marsYears) 
// 5.) Test if caculations apply properly to display users age on Jupiter. if (jupiterAge, galacticAge = age * jupiterYears)
// 6.) Test if calculation for life expectancy is initialized. (lifeExpectancy(planet)) 
// 7.) Test if calculations apply in order to show the user's life expectancy on Mercury. (lifeExpectancy(Mercury))_
// 8.) Test if calculations apply in order to show the user's life expectancy on Venus.(lifeExpectancy(Venus))_
// 9.) Test if calculations apply in order to show the user's life expectancy on Mars.(lifeExpectancy(Mars))_
// 10.) Test if calculations apply in order to show the user's life expectancy on Jupiter. (lifeExpectancy(Jupiter))_
